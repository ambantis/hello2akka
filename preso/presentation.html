					<h2>Let's Play with Play!</h2>
          <p>There's a lot of buz about Playframework<br>Let's find out why</p>

            <h2>What is Play?</h2>
            <p>
              Play is a "high-velocity" web framework that is asynchronous and developer-friendly.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            Play is asynchronous because it is built upon Netty (a web server implementing Java NIO.2)
            and Akka. Asynchronous means that the application resources are not tied up waiting for
            a response from IO or web service calls.
          </section>

          <section>
            Play is developer-friendly because <em>everything</em> is static, which means the compiler
            catches errors in the entire application, not just the java/scala code. Play also has lots
            of other cool features.

              SBT is the build tool of scala. It comes built-in with Playframework, but if you want
              to run the code samples at <a href="https://www.github.com/ambantis/hello2akka">
              www.github/ambantis/hello2Akka</a>, then download it at:

            <h2>Concurrency, Java-style</h2>
            <p>All About Monica and Ryan</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Monica and Ryan have a joint checking account. This is what it looks like:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim>
    public class BankAccount {
      private int balance;

      public BankAccount() {
        balance = 100;
      }

      public void withdraw(int amount) {
        balance -= amount;
      }

      public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
      }
    }
            </code></pre>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Monica and Ryan are constantly causing their account to be overdrawn, because even though
              they check the balance before making a withdrawal, they are threads accessing a state
              at the same time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Go ahead and try it at the command line. If you have sbt installed, then at the command
              line run RyanAndMonicaJob
            </p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
  % sbt "runMain threads.RyanAndMonicaJob"
            </code></pre>

            <p>
              And here's the output you might get:
            </p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
    Monica says, 'I found something ...'
    Monica is going to sleep
    Sorry, not enough for Ryan
    Sorry, not enough for Ryan
    Sorry, not enough for Ryan
    Sorry, not enough for Ryan
    Sorry, not enough for Ryan
    Monica has woken up.
    Monica completes the withdrawal
    Overdrawn!

            <p>
              There's ways to deal with concurrency in thread-based systems, but all of them are
              complicated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Wouldn't it be great if the developer could spend more time creating new features and
              enhancing the user experience rather than dealing with concurrency?

            <h2>Akka Actors to the Rescue!</h2>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>With Akka, Monica and Ryan aren't threads, they're actors. Actors can't access state
            of other actors, all they can do is pass messages to other actors. The messages contain
            immutable data structures (cannot be changed).
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Everything's locked down with Akka</h2>
            <p>
              There is no shared state, so there is no need for locks, synchronization, and no
              concurrency bugs to track down.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Here's the list of messages the Akka bank will accept:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim>
    object BankAccount {
      case class Withdraw(amount: Int)
      object Balance
      object ChaChing
      object NSF
    }
            </code></pre>

            <p>
              Only the BankAccount object can alter state. Other actors can send messages requesting
              that state be changed, but the bank processes those messages, not Monica and Rynan
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Go ahead and try it at the command line. If you have sbt installed, then at the command
              line run the actor demo:
            </p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
    % sbt "runMain actordemo.Boot"
            </code></pre>

            <p>
              And here's the output you might get:
            </p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
    Ryan says, 'It costs 1 dollar?!?, I'll buy it, but first I'll rest'
    Bank says, 'Ryan asks to withdraw 1'
    Bank says, 'The shoppers have a zero balance, time to go back to work.'
            </code></pre>

            <h2>So, What does this all mean?</h2>
            <p>Play! only runs on a handful of threads.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Play! doesn't use thread-pools. If your web server has three cores, then Play! uses
              three threads for the application.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's that simple!</p>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Wait a minute !?!</h2>
          <p>
            If Play! only uses a couple of threads, wouldn't blocking I/O bring the server to
            it's knees?

            <h2>Akka Futures to the rescue!</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              When Play encounters an expensive computation or I/O, it places the future results
              of that computation or I/O in a socket and keeps on going. When the future has a value,
              then there is a callback to redeem the promise of a future value for a real value.
            </p>

            <h2>Let's run some Akka Future code!</h2>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>In the code snippet below, </p>

            <pre><code data-trim>

    object Boot extends App {

      val fiveHundred = 500
      implicit val timeout = Timeout(5 seconds)

      println("this is before the expensive computation")

      val futureResult: Future[(Int, Double)] = future {
        getNaturalNumbersWith(divisors = fiveHundred)
      }

      futureResult.map { x =>
        println(s"first triangle # with $fiveHundred divisors = " +
        s"${x._1} with a time of ${x._2} secs")
      }

      println("this is after the expensive computation")
    }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              we have a println statement before and after the expensive computation.
            </p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <p>If you run it from the command line:</p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
              % sbt "runMain futuredemo.Boot
            </code></pre>
            <p>You'll see output something like this:</p>

            <pre><code data-trim>
    this is before the expensive computation
    this is after the expensive computation
    [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Sep 25, 2013 12:18:24 AM
    > first triangle # with 500 divisors = 76576500 with a time of 0.99 secs
            </code></pre>
            <p>The result occurs after the program finishes running!</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              In a Play! controller, the web page results will not display until all the I/O is
              completed. So, from the perspective of the client, the application is synchronous, but
              application resources are never tied up waiting for I/O.
